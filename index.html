  <p>
    This demo simulates an app capturing information about an object (via the Vision Pro)
    and sending it to a server to retrieve additional details to send back to the Apple Vision Pros. Read down below for more information!
    Right now it is choosing an image from the Vision Pros camera roll to send over and as shown in the demo it retreives the info from the server.
